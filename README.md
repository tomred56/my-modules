# MyModules

### A collection of Python modules that I use in multiple projects

Nothing fancy, and certainly not world class professional programming! These are often the result of multiple attempts to make something work. When there is a working version in a project, I abstract it as a class or as a set of functions and aim to make it as generic / parameter driven as possible.

I develop in PyCharm Community Edition, with Python 3.8+. GUI elements are built using wxPython with wxFormBuilder as an editor. DB is usually MariaDB accessed through pymysql.

I try out new ways of doing things, so the code may not be the most appropriate or pythonic. 

| Current Modules | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| db_signin       | Class to open link to MariaDB using a form                   |
| smbshares       | Class to trawl the local network and find available file shares |
|                 |                                                              |
